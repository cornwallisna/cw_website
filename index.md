## Join the club!

It is that time of year again to pay your CNA dues.  See the [membership information](membership.html) for details.

## Block Party!

Our Annual Block Party will take place on March 6th with a rain out date of March 7th.  It will take place from the corner of 2803 SE 22nd place to 2215 SE 28th Terrace.  If you would like to join us please RSVP to Karla Martinez at  [karladmartinez@yahoo.com](mailto:karladmartinez@yahoo.com) or [919-830-8734](tel:919-830-8734).  We ask that everyone bring a dish and let Karla know.  Please do not forget your chairs.  The association will provide the meat along with paper products, and non-alcoholic beverages.  You can BYOB.  If you would like to help set up (10:00am - 11:00am) or tear down (5:00pm - 6:00pm), please notify Karla.  As is the norm we ask that you wear your masks and practice social distancing. Hope to see everyone there.

In light of the coronavirus we have decided to make our Annual Block Party a "Bring your own Picnic Lunch" party.The CNA board will be providing bottled drinks and CafeYou will provide the wonderful desserts again this year.  It will take place on the corner of <b>SE 28th terrace and SE 22nd Place</b>. The event will start at 1:00 pm and end at 5:00pm Saturday, March 6th.  It is also a BYOB event. We have around 35 people who have responded and I look forward to a happy occasion.  Don't forget your lawn chair.  I am hoping that with the vaccines rolling out that we will have our normal Block Party next year.
