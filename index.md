## Join the club!

It is that time of year again to pay your CNA dues.  See the [membership information](membership.html) for details.

# December 7th, 2021 is CNA officer elections

To all CNA members, lease attend the December 7th general meeting.  It will be the last meeting of the year so new officers will be elected.  Please consider donating your time.  We will also be voting on a membership dues increase.  Thankfully we were reminded that membership dues are in the Bi-Laws and have to be voted on to change.  We are proposing to raise them from $20.00 to $25.00.  The dues have been changed back and forth from these two amounts since 1993 when the first board was elected. Rosemary Boon and Gail Balsamo were our first Secretaries.

# Flood insurance meeting at the Yacht Club

I wanted to make sure that everyone was made aware of the upcoming meeting set for tomorrow, Oct 12th from 5:30 - 8:30pm at the Cape Coral Yacht Club ballroom. It is located at 5819 Driftwood Parkway Cape Coral, FL. The topic will be upcoming flood insurance changes via the  FEMA RISK RATING 2.0.  If you do not know we are in a Flood Zone AE.

* City Planning Coordinator  Wyatt Daltry
