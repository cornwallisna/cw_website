Hi All

Now that summer is officially here, it’s a good time to check in with neighbors and let them know when you are leaving/returning.  Cornwallis is a place where neighbors look out for each other.  Something to put on your calendar, our annual Christmas party on December 11, 2021.  It’s a bit down the road but it is scheduled, and we are excited to have more things to look forward to.  We will have the website up soon which will make it much easier to keep in touch.  The newsletter will also be available on-line so if you haven’t already, please send your email to me (text or email) and I will update our member list so that you will receive the newsletter (no spam mail, I promise).  Enjoy the longer days, greener grass, and warmer water that summer brings!  I look forward to seeing you around the neighborhood.


Sandra Wall
CNA Vice-President
