# Reviewers checklist

First, thank you for taking the time to review the [cornwallisna website]({{site.baseurl}}).  As you click around, there are a few things you should look for.  Below are a set of suggestions for things to keep in mind, by no means is it a complete list.  The website is designed using what is known as a *responsive design*.  This is intended to automatically adapt to different browsers (chrome, firefox, IE, Edge etc) as well as adapt itself to smaller screens such as a phone or iPad.  You can simulate this by resizing your browser window on the computer, or, you could just use your iPad ;-)  Please be sure to note what platform or window size you are using when commenting as this may be relevant in correcting any problems.   Please be sure to note the url (page address) when commenting.  For example, this page is found at <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/reviewers.html">{{site.baseurl}}/reviewers.html</a>. All of the top level pages are uniquely named.   You would want to note that it is on the 'reviewers' page.

Please file these as website feedback using the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/issues.html">feedback link</a> which is also found at the bottom of every page.

* Did anything confuse you?

## Completeness of information
