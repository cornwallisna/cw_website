## You can now send your membership renewal with [Zelle(c)](https://www.zellepay.com/how-it-works)

Zelle is an online person-to-person, person-to-business payment service.  Your bank likely already supports Zelle from your banking dashboard.  For example,
    at Chase, you can login and go to your <b>Pay & Transfer</b> menu entry and select <b>Payment Center</b>.  You should see a screen like [Chase dashboard for Zelle](images/zelle-at-chase.png).   From there you can enroll in Zelle and add a new recipient of <b>cornwallis_na@gmail.com</b>.  Your payment via Zelle will automatically send a notification to the board along with your membership contribution to the CNA account.   You can also download the [Getting started with Zelle](https://www.zellepay.com/go/zelle) app for your iPhone or Android device.
