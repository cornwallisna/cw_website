# HALLOWEEN Highlights from 2021

Halloween 2021 Spooktacular was a Spectacular Neighborhood Event
It was a beautiful evening for the 50 or 60 trick or treaters and parents that came down 29th Street. A
special THANK YOU!!! to the Cornwallis Neighborhood Association who provided the hot dogs, chips and
bottles of water which were served at the hostess home of Mary Ellen &amp; Joe Saba. Many thanks to Tony
Karp, for cooking the delicious hot dogs. And thanks to several of the biking neighbors who kept us
informed of the crowds all around the neighborhood. We heard Cornwallis Parkway and the river streets
had trick or treaters until almost 10pm. It was a fun night for us older folks sitting in our driveways along
29th Street seeing the cute creative costumes. One neighbor, Evan Pinther, gave out Candy with sweet
liqueur as treats for the adults!! The adults were delighted and thanked Evan. The evening was a
SUCCESS because we got to reminisce with old and new neighbors and the kids enjoyed huge bags of
candy. Next year, please contact Mary Ellen (239-699-0571) if you would like to participate either
helping with the event or a candy stop.
