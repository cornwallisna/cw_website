I have really enjoyed my bike riding this past summer and now into fall.  First of all you learn the streets in the neighborhood, and we have a lot.  Next, you watch the owls grow up in the summer, houses being built, renovations taking place, new landscaping, and finally, you meet great people and their pets.  Cornwallis Neighborhood is a great place to live.  Going into Fall I have the pleasure of seeing the School buses and kids waiting at bus stops.  I sure do miss my kids and those days.  And then there is the holiday decorations.  I have adjusted my times of riding so that I could capture some wonderful Halloween/Fall decorations.  Some residents in our neighborhood go all out.  I have included some pictures for your enjoyment.  If you have a chance venture out and enjoy our neighborhood.  Maybe even a bike ride.
