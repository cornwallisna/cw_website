Hello Neighbors,

At this very special time of year the Board sends wishes to our CNA members and their families as well as our extended community for a very happy, joyous, and safe Holiday season. Also, early wishes for a Healthy, Safe, and prosperous New Year!


We continue to welcome back more of our snowbirds. We look forward to catching up and spending time together, welcome back – we missed you.
For all our new owners and renters, on behalf of the Board and entire CNA membership we welcome you with open arms to the prestigious Cornwallis Community. If you have not already done so, we strongly encourage you to join and participate in the (CNA) Cornwallis Neighborhood Association and direct you to our website [https://cornwallisna.org](https://cornwallisna.org).


With the “High Season” upon us and the resulting influx of people, gatherings, and outside activities in our community, we ask everyone to be diligent and do their part to keep our community safe & clean. Please drive slowly and abide by the posted speed limits on Cornwallis and all side streets. Slow down, please! This stated, please expect to see more visibility of CCPD in our community. Please be watchful and respectful of all children, walkers, cyclists, and dog walkers. Slow down! Please always leash your dog(s) and always pick up their waste. Pick it up for health & environmental reasons for the sake of all and other animals.


On behalf of the Board, we thank all our members for their ongoing commitment, participation, and support! We continue to enjoy meeting, chatting, and getting to know all our neighbors. Most importantly, we thank you for your opinions, inputs, and suggestions towards enhancing CNA and our new website.


In line with the above, as previously reported our 2021 membership grew to 250 members with more still joining. For this milestone, we thank all our Block Captains (18) led by Gayle Schwantes for their efforts to reach out and go door to door. Kindly refer to our Treasurer’s report on our website for more details.  Worth noting is that our 2022 membership drive has kicked off with annual dues at $20. Please see our website for further information, membership forms (electronic and or printed form) and all other pertinent details. We want to highlight that your dues can now be paid via Zelle. Again, we direct you to our website. [https://cornwallisna.org](https://cornwallisna.org)


In October we had the inaugural launch of the first ever CNA website. It can be accessed as follows; [https://cornwallisna.org](https://cornwallisna.org). Once on the website please refer to the top of the page “HELP” icon for Navigational information, menu system & selection/details and useful tips on getting around the site.
We do ask that all our members become familiar with & utilize the website.  We look to you to provide newsworthy articles, pictures, constructive feedback, or perhaps become a part of the webmaster team. For example, we need volunteers for the web team and need a web content manager. Please strongly consider volunteering. Reach out to any board member or Fred Cassirer, our Web Master. You can also email us at [cornwallisna@gmail.com](mailto:cornwallisna@gmail.com)


The CNA Board is requesting for someone to step up and volunteer to fill our open secretary position. Karla Martinez (our current and interim) Secretary will step down at end of this year. Please consider volunteering & stepping forward.
On a special note, and on behalf of the board and all our membership, we want to acknowledge Karla for her 4 years of service and thank her for all her efforts and applaud her contributions. She has served with commitment, dedication, and passion! We will miss her.

Our next CNA general meeting will be *January 18, 2022 @7:15pm*. Our special guest speaker at this meeting will be advised shortly on our website & website calendar. Kindly refer to same.
Other upcoming 2022 dates to hold are the following.
*February 22*, General Membership Meeting with Guest Speaker CC Code Compliance
*February 18 & 19* – CNA Neighborhood Wide Garage Sale
*March 12* -CNA Neighborhood Block Party
*March 22* - General Membership Meeting with Guest Speaker (to be advised)

In closing, please remember membership is open to all residents of Cornwallis so if you are looking to make new friends or get involved and have fun, please join. Spread the word!
Also, we do have CNA T- Shirts and Tote bags available for sale. Pease refer to the CNA website calendar for forthcoming activities.

I look forward to meeting more of our members and seeing you at the upcoming general meetings and events as well getting your constructive ideas.

I want to leave you with a parting thought. Volunteerism is the key element necessary to run CNA. Becoming a volunteer is easy, after all I am a volunteer as are all the Board members and current volunteers already serving. I thank all of you! With this in mind, we do need more people to volunteer some time to serve on the Board or committees such as the Beautification and Social Events/& Planning. To volunteer or buy a T-shirt or Tote bag, please reach out to any board member by phone or feel to email us at cornwallisna@gmail.com

All the best,

_Ron Jenoriki_

**CNA President**
