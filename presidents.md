Hello Neighbors,

It’s hard to believe that summer is already upon us. While we welcome the seasonal fun and sun summer brings, we also know that with the seasonal transition many of our neighbors and friends head north. To all our snowbirds, we wish you safe travels and know we will miss you. For all our new owners and renters, we welcome you with open arms to the prestigious Cornwallis Community. We encourage you to join and participate in the (CNA) Cornwallis Neighborhood Association if you haven’t already.

We are mindful that Hurricane season is upon us and as such we remind all our residents to prepare and stock up accordingly. For our new owners and renters should you have questions on Hurricane readiness feel free to reach out and or access all the local, county and state websites containing this information.

On behalf of the Board, we thank all our members for their ongoing commitment, participation, and support! We continue to enjoy meeting, chatting, and getting to know all our neighbors. Most importantly, we thank you for your opinions, inputs, and suggestions towards enhancing CNA.

In line with the above, I am happy to report that our membership has now grown to 234 members with more still joining. For this milestone, we must thank all our Block Captains (18) led by Gayle Schwantes for their tireless efforts to reach out and go door to door. Kindly refer to our Treasurers report for more details.

Although in our rearview mirror, we had both a successful annual Neighborhood Garage Sale & Block Party. These events are successful due to CNA volunteers, leadership, and teamwork. Thank you to Karla & Jose Martinez and family, Ann Vaughn, and Sandra Wall. Also, a special thank you to Marlies Laaper, Owner of Café You, for donating the delicious deserts for the block party.

As previously reported, we are continuing our work on the Website for CNA. We have made significant progress and anticipate a rollout in the July/August timeframe or sooner if possible. The Board remains teamed up with our neighborhood expert Software Consultant, Fred Cassirer. Thank you, Fred!  We will keep you posted and provide more details on the forthcoming rollout. Stay tuned!

Although a major point of frustration the past few months, we are all happy to see that the Waste Pro disposal matter has significantly improved. Please be aware that your CNA Board as well as many residents were in contact with both the City and Waste Pro during this dilemma, to ensure our neighborhood was getting attention. Our voices were getting heard!

I want to again mention that the Board is looking for someone to fill our secretary position. Karla Martinez (our current and interim) Secretary, agreed to continue to hold this key position until a volunteer(s) come forward and one can be appointed to fill this position. Please consider volunteering & stepping forward.

As we are now into the heat of the season, our next CNA general meeting will be October 19, 2021 @7:15pm. If you have not done so already, please pay your dues utilizing the form included in this newsletter. Remember membership is open to all residents of Cornwallis so if you are looking to make new friends or get involved and have fun, please join. Spread the word!
Also, we do have CNA T- Shirts and Tote bags available for sale. Pease refer to the CNA Events schedule in the newsletter for forthcoming activities.

I look forward to meeting more of our members and seeing you at the upcoming meetings and events as well getting your constructive ideas.

I want to leave you with a parting thought. Volunteerism is the key element necessary to run CNA. Becoming a volunteer is easy, after all I am a volunteer as are all the Board members and current volunteers already serving. I thank all of you! With this in mind, we do need more people to volunteer some time to serve on the board or committees such as the Beautification and Social Events/& Planning. To volunteer or buy a T-shirt or Tote bag, please reach out to any Board member by phone or feel to email us at cornwallisna@gmail.com

All the best,

Ron Jenoriki
CNA President
