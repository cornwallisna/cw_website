Hello Neighbors,


A happy fall to all and I hope this message finds our family of CNA members and extended community happy, safe, and in good health. Fall is now upon us, and we anxiously await the cooler and more moderate temperatures. It sure was a hot and humid summer and I am ready for some cool down in the temperatures.  With the change in the season comes the anticipated excitement of welcoming back all our snowbirds. We look forward to catching up and spending time together, welcome back – we missed you.  This also means that very special time of year - Holiday Season is just around the corner. Cheer and Fun!!


For all our new owners and renters, on behalf of the Board and entire CNA we welcome you with open arms to the prestigious Cornwallis Community. If you have not already done so, we strongly encourage you to join and participate in the (CNA) Cornwallis Neighborhood Association.


With the “High Season” upon us and the resulting influx of people, gatherings, and outside activities in our community, we ask everyone to be diligent and do their part to keep our community safe & clean. Please drive slowly and abide by the posted speed limits on Cornwallis and all side streets. Slow down. This stated, please expect to see more visibility of CCPD in our community. Please be watchful and respectful of all children, walkers, cyclists, and dog walkers. Slow down. Please always leash your dog(s) and always pick up their waste. Pick it up for health & environmental reasons for the sake of all and other animals.


On behalf of the Board, we thank all our members for their ongoing commitment, participation, and support! We continue to enjoy meeting, chatting, and getting to know all our neighbors. Most importantly, we thank you for your opinions, inputs, and suggestions towards enhancing CNA.


In line with the above, I am happy to report that our membership has now grown to 250 members with more still joining. For this milestone, we thank all our Block Captains (18) led by Gayle Schwantes for their efforts to reach out and go door to door. Kindly refer to our Treasurer’s report for more details.  Starting in October we will kick off the 2022 membership drive with annual dues at $20. However, as previously communicated, the board has proposed an increase to $25. for 2023. As per CNA bylaws, this will be voted on at our upcoming December 7th meeting. Our intent is to provide membership much advanced notice.


We are extremely excited about the inaugural launch of the first ever CNA website. It can be accessed as follows; [https://cornwallisna.org](https://cornwallisna.org). Once on the website please refer to the top of the page “HELP” icon for Navigational information, menu system & selection/details and useful tips on getting around the site. I want to personally acknowledge and thank Fred Cassirer (Webmaster) for his tireless efforts, patience, and expertise in working with the Board to develop and guide us through this journey from concept to rollout. Fred, on behalf of the entire board and our CNA community we thank you and applaud your contributions! We also want to thank Marcelle for her support and cooperation as we know we stole much family time away. Thank you, Marcelle. Also, a special thanks to our members who volunteered to test pilot the website and provided feedback and to my fellow board members for all their commitment and dedication to help drive the project to completion.
We do ask that all our members become familiar with & utilize the website.  We look to you to provide newsworthy articles, pictures, constructive feedback, or perhaps become a part of the webmaster team. For example, we now need a web content manager. Please consider volunteering. Reach out to any board member or Fred. You can also email us at [cornwallisna@gmail.com](mailto:cornwallisna@gmail.com)



As mentioned before, the CNA Board is looking for someone to fill our secretary position. Karla Martinez (our current and interim) Secretary, agreed to continue to hold this key position until a volunteer(s) come forward and one can be appointed to fill this position. Please consider volunteering & stepping forward.


Our next CNA general meeting will be **October 19, 2021 @7:15pm.** Our special guest speaker at this meeting will be Mayor John Gunter. For our **December 7, 2021**, meeting, our guest speaker will be Rob Hernandez, Cape Coral City Manager.  We will also have our Board elections at the December Meeting.  On December 11 the annual Christmas party will be held at Terrace Hall. You can check these dates/details on the website calendar


If you have not done so already, please pay your dues utilizing the electronic form included on the website and or one provided by the block captains. Remember membership is open to all residents of Cornwallis so if you are looking to make new friends or get involved and have fun, please join. Spread the word!
Also, we do have CNA T- Shirts and Tote bags available for sale. Pease refer to the CNA website calendar for forthcoming activities.


I look forward to meeting more of our members and seeing you at the upcoming general meetings and events as well getting your constructive ideas. 


I want to leave you with a parting thought. Volunteerism is the key element necessary to run CNA. Becoming a volunteer is easy, after all I am a volunteer as are all the Board members and current volunteers already serving. I thank all of you! With this in mind, we do need more people to volunteer some time to serve on the Board or committees such as the Beautification and Social Events/& Planning. To volunteer or buy a T-shirt or Tote bag, please reach out to any board member by phone or feel to email us at [cornwallisna@gmail.com](cornwallisna@gmail.com)



All the best,

_Ron Jenoriki_

**CNA President**
