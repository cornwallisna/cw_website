In spite of all the restrictions this past year, our Association remains strong and active. Last year our total membership was 214. We currently have 234 YTD and more to come.  We have added many new members this year and very grateful for their involvement.  Also, very thankful for all members that have made additional contributions in addition to your dues.  Please note our newsletter sponsors…. these are business owners who live in our community. Would encourage you to consider them when looking for services and/or products. Our membership success is a credit to our 18 Block Captains. They have done a terrific job covering our community. A shout out goes to Gayle Schwantes for her leadership and the Team’s passion for making this a very successful membership year. Her team includes the following:
