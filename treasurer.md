In spite of all the restrictions this past year, our Association remains strong and active. Last year our total membership was 214. We currently have 250 YTD which puts us at a tie with our top year. The previous record high membership was 250 which occurred in 2019. Â We have added many new members this year and very grateful for their involvement.Â  Also extremely thankful for all members that have made additional contributions in addition to their dues.Â A huge shout out to our 18 Block Captains. Without their dedication and persistence, this would not have happened. They have done a terrific job covering our community. Thanks to Gayle Schwantes for her leadership and the Teamâ€™s passion for making this a very successful membership year. Her team includes our following neighbors:Â Â

On a personal note, my wife Helen and I moved into CNA 18 years ago. We transitioned from living on our boat in Tarpon Point Marina for the previous 7 years. Itâ€™s been an enriching and exciting part of our lives.
Great community, wonderful people/neighbors and fabulous experience from the very first day we arrived.Â  Our thanks to all that have made this such an enjoyable part of our livesðŸ˜Š.Â Â
